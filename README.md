# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my first final project from the **Learn HTML & CSS** course!

This is a **single-page personal portfolio website** built from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with **Vite** as the development tool.

The goal of this project is to apply everything I’ve learned — including semantic HTML, layout techniques, responsive design, and accessibility — in a real-world context.
